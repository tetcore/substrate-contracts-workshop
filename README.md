# Tetcore Contracts Workshop

This is a self-guided tutorial which will teach you how to build [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/) smart contracts on [Tetcore](https://github.com/tetcoin/tetcore) using [Tetsy pro!](https://github.com/tetcoin/pro/).

We will cover:

1. Installing prerequisites on your computer
2. Using the ink! CLI to start a new project
3. Building and testing our contract
4. Deploying our contract on a local Substrate node
5. Interacting with our contract using the Polkadot UI
6. Creating a Basic flipper contract.
7. Creating a Simple incrementer contract.
8. Creating a more complex ERC20 contract.

We would love for you to give feedback in these early stages, so open an issue or a PR!
